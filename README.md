# Orthomosaic_Tools
This repository contains programs to orthomosaic videos from 4 overhead cameras. 

## Downloading and Setting Up These Programs


## Selecting Targets
In order to orthorectify the videos on each camera and line them up in space, the x and y pixel coordinates of targets within each cameras frame must be known and related to real world coordinates. Included in this repository is a program to find the pixel locations of targets with an image or video stream (as long and the targets are not moving in relation to the camera).
